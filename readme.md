## Wins/Losses with Functions

Write a program that reads in a wins and losses and outputs the winning percentage. You should use at least four user defined functions:
- `getWins` - a value returning function that prompts for the wins (no parameters)
- `getLosses` - a value returning function that prompts for the losses (no parameters)
- `calcWinPercent` - a value returning function that calculates the winning percentage (2 parameters, wins and losses)
- `displayWinPercent` - a void function for displaying result (1 parameter, winning percentage)

The percentage should be printed as a percent to two decimal places.  

_Sample Run:_

Please input the number of wins **80**
Please input the number of losses **40** 
The percentage of wins is 66.67%
